\chapter{Conclusions}
AI is definitely a solution that we need and like must use. But it important to realize that it is not an all in one perfect solution. It comes with benefits and disadvantages. The good thing this AI is an partner to humans, like a very capable assistant. it is worth it to take those risks as Ai does not need to directly be pitted against human, their jobs etc. It also inherently learns to solve those conflicts and find unexpected solution. This means the solutions can be bad and thus we still have to be careful.
